# TrafficManagementSystem
The main moto of this project is to design a Four way Smart Traffic Light Controller by input sensors and alert sensors using Verilog (Intersection of one Highway road and one Narrow road).

Our purpose is to make the existing Traffic Light System a “SMART ONE” by incorporating the specialised Timers , sensors and alerts to face any situations wisely.

What's New ??????

Timers : These are used to control the traffic efficiently …where the Highway Road is given high preference compared to narrow road which includes less no . of vehicles…And This is done through giving more time space (30 sec)for green light to Highway road and less time(10 sec) for narrow road….

Vehicle Sensors: Senses the vehicles presence…if not the sensor will direct to next road sensor…... Thereby saves the time …

Emergency purposes : If any protocols and emergency situations occurs all the traffic lights will go on RED for certain time period…..like Ambulance Entry , Ministers Entry …

Alerts : Alert 1 internally connected to dividers .. where if there is any collisions due to accidents ,it detects directly contacts to nearby Police Control Room and Hospital .. And Alert 2 detects the collisions between vehicles and perform the same…….
